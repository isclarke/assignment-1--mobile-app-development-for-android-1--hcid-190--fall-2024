# Fall 2024 Mobile App Development for Android I — Assignment 1

* **Read these instructions repeatedly until you understand, then begin your project. If something is not clear, ask.**

## ❖ Before You Begin ❖

1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/). **Ensure you check the box that asks if you *only* want to copy the `DONT-WORK-HERE` branch**.
3. Launch your command line interface, or CLI.
4. Use `gh` to clone your repo: `gh repo clone USERNAME/REPO-NAME`, where `USERNAME` is *your* GitHub username, not mine, and `REPO-NAME` is the name of this repo.
5. Create a branch with your first name and last name, all lower case and separated by a dash (no spaces). For example, my branch would be called `roy-vanegas` and I’d create it as follows: `git checkout -b roy-vanegas`. For there to be an upstream branch, I’d then do, `git push --set-upstream origin roy-vanegas`.
6. Checkout our your new personalized branch.
7. Do all your work in your personalized branch.
